Justification for MVVM design choice:

For client application development, MVVM is better than other MV* patterns like MVC or MVP.
Why? Because a view model, as the extra abstraction of the view's data and behavior, has a higher abstraction level than other MV* patterns. Furthermore, view models are totally decoupled from views through databinding. The higher abstraction level and more complete decoupling lead to a cleaner architecture.
